Commandline Options
===================

A quick way to see all of Toil's commandline options is by executing the following on a toil script::

    $ toil example.py --help

For a basic toil workflow, Toil has one mandatory argument, the job store.  All other arguments are optional.

The Job Store
-------------

Running toil scripts requires a filepath or url to a centralizing location for all of the files of the workflow.
This is Toil's one required positional argument: the job store.  To use the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>` example,
if you're on a node that has a large **/scratch** volume, you can specify that the jobstore be created there by
executing: ``python HelloWorld.py /scratch/my-job-store``, or more explicitly,
``python HelloWorld.py file:/scratch/my-job-store``.

Syntax for specifying different job stores:

    Local: ``file:job-store-name``

    AWS: ``aws:region-here:job-store-name``

    Google: ``google:projectID-here:job-store-name``

Different types of job store options can be found below.

Commandline Options
-------------------

**Core Toil Options**

  --workDir WORKDIR     Absolute path to directory where temporary files
                        generated during the Toil run should be placed. Temp
                        files and folders, as well as standard output and error
                        from batch system jobs (unless --noStdOutErr), will be
                        placed in a directory toil-<workflowID> within workDir.
                        The workflowID is generated by Toil and will be reported
                        in the workflow logs. Default is determined by the variables
                        (TMPDIR, TEMP, TMP) via mkdtemp. This directory needs to
                        exist on all machines running jobs; if capturing standard
                        output and error from batch system jobs is desired, it will
                        generally need to be on a shared file system.
  --noStdOutErr         Do not capture standard output and error from batch system jobs.
  --stats               Records statistics about the toil workflow to be used
                        by 'toil stats'.
  --clean=STATE
                        Determines the deletion of the jobStore upon
                        completion of the program. Choices: 'always',
                        'onError','never', or 'onSuccess'. The -\\-stats option
                        requires information from the jobStore upon completion
                        so the jobStore will never be deleted with that flag.
                        If you wish to be able to restart the run, choose
                        'never' or 'onSuccess'. Default is 'never' if stats is
                        enabled, and 'onSuccess' otherwise
  --cleanWorkDir STATE
                        Determines deletion of temporary worker directory upon
                        completion of a job. Choices: 'always', 'never',
                        'onSuccess'. Default = always. WARNING: This option
                        should be changed for debugging only. Running a full
                        pipeline with this option could fill your disk with
                        intermediate data.
  --clusterStats FILEPATH
                        If enabled, writes out JSON resource usage statistics
                        to a file. The default location for this file is the
                        current working directory, but an absolute path can
                        also be passed to specify where this file should be
                        written. This option only applies when using scalable
                        batch systems.
  --restart             If -\\-restart is specified then will attempt to restart
                        existing workflow at the location pointed to by the
                        -\\-jobStore option. Will raise an exception if the
                        workflow does not exist.

**Logging Options**

Toil hides stdout and stderr by default except in case of job failure.  Log levels in toil are based on priority from
the logging module:

  --logOff
                        Only CRITICAL log levels are shown.
                        Equivalent to ``--logLevel=OFF`` or ``--logLevel=CRITICAL``.
  --logCritical
                        Only CRITICAL log levels are shown.
                        Equivalent to ``--logLevel=OFF`` or ``--logLevel=CRITICAL``.
  --logError
                        Only ERROR, and CRITICAL log levels are shown.
                        Equivalent to ``--logLevel=ERROR``.
  --logWarning
                        Only WARN, ERROR, and CRITICAL log levels are shown.
                        Equivalent to ``--logLevel=WARNING``.
  --logInfo
                        All log statements are shown, except DEBUG.
                        Equivalent to ``--logLevel=INFO``.
  --logDebug
                        All log statements are shown.
                        Equivalent to ``--logLevel=DEBUG``.
  --logLevel=LOGLEVEL
                        May be set to: ``OFF`` (or ``CRITICAL``),
                        ``ERROR``, ``WARN`` (or ``WARNING``), ``INFO``, or ``DEBUG``.
  --logFile FILEPATH
                        Specifies a file path to write the logging output to.
  --rotatingLogging
                        Turn on rotating logging, which prevents log files from
                        getting too big (set using ``--maxLogFileSize BYTESIZE``).
  --maxLogFileSize BYTESIZE
                        Sets the maximum log file size in bytes (``--rotatingLogging`` must be active).

**Batch System Options**

  --batchSystem BATCHSYSTEM
                        The type of batch system to run the job(s) with,
                        currently can be one of lsf, Mesos, slurm, torque,
                        htcondor, single_machine, parasol, grid_engine', kubernetes.
                        (default: single_machine)
  --parasolCommand PARASOLCOMMAND
                        The name or path of the parasol program. Will be
                        looked up on PATH unless it starts with a
                        slash. (default: parasol)
  --parasolMaxBatches PARASOLMAXBATCHES
                        Maximum number of job batches the Parasol batch is
                        allowed to create. One batch is created for jobs with
                        a unique set of resource requirements. (default: 1000)
  --scale SCALE         A scaling factor to change the value of all submitted
                        tasks' submitted cores. Used in singleMachine batch
                        system. (default: 1)
  --linkImports         When using Toil's importFile function for staging,
                        input files are copied to the job store. Specifying
                        this option saves space by sym-linking imported files.
                        As long as caching is enabled Toil will protect the
                        file automatically by changing the permissions to
                        read-only.
  --mesosMaster MESOSMASTERADDRESS
                        The host and port of the Mesos master separated by a
                        colon. (default: 169.233.147.202:5050)

**Autoscaling Options**

  --provisioner CLOUDPROVIDER
                        The provisioner for cluster auto-scaling. The
                        currently supported choices are 'aws' or 'gce'. The
                        default is None.
  --nodeTypes NODETYPES
                        Specifies a list of comma-separated node types, each of which is 
                        composed of slash-separated instance types, and an optional spot 
                        bid set off by a colon, making the node type preemptable. Instance 
                        types may appear in multiple node types, and the same node type 
                        may appear as both preemptable and non-preemptable.
                        Valid argument specifying two node types:
                            c5.4xlarge/c5a.4xlarge:0.42,t2.large
                        Node types:
                            c5.4xlarge/c5a.4xlarge:0.42 and t2.large
                        Instance types:
                            c5.4xlarge, c5a.4xlarge, and t2.large
                        Semantics:
                            Bid $0.42/hour for either c5.4xlarge or c5a.4xlarge instances,
                            treated interchangeably, while they are available at that price,
                            and buy t2.large instances at full price
  --minNodes MINNODES   Minimum number of nodes of each type in the cluster,
                        if using auto-scaling. This should be provided as a
                        comma-separated list of the same length as the list of
                        node types. default=0
  --maxNodes MAXNODES   Maximum number of nodes of each type in the cluster,
                        if using autoscaling, provided as a comma-separated
                        list. The first value is used as a default if the list
                        length is less than the number of nodeTypes.
                        default=10
  --preemptableCompensation PREEMPTABLECOMPENSATION
                        The preference of the autoscaler to replace
                        preemptable nodes with non-preemptable nodes, when
                        preemptable nodes cannot be started for some reason.
                        Defaults to 0.0. This value must be between 0.0 and
                        1.0, inclusive. A value of 0.0 disables such
                        compensation, a value of 0.5 compensates two missing
                        preemptable nodes with a non-preemptable one. A value
                        of 1.0 replaces every missing pre-emptable node with a
                        non-preemptable one.
  --nodeStorage NODESTORAGE
                        Specify the size of the root volume of worker nodes
                        when they are launched in gigabytes. You may want to
                        set this if your jobs require a lot of disk space. The
                        default value is 50.
  --nodeStorageOverrides NODESTORAGEOVERRIDES
                        Comma-separated list of nodeType:nodeStorage that are used
                        to override the default value from --nodeStorage for the
                        specified nodeType(s). This is useful for heterogeneous jobs
                        where some tasks require much more disk than others.
  --metrics             Enable the prometheus/grafana dashboard for monitoring
                        CPU/RAM usage, queue size, and issued jobs.
  --defaultMemory INT   The default amount of memory to request for a job.
                        Only applicable to jobs that do not specify an
                        explicit value for this requirement. Standard suffixes
                        like K, Ki, M, Mi, G or Gi are supported. Default is
                        2.0G
  --defaultCores FLOAT  The default number of CPU cores to dedicate a job.
                        Only applicable to jobs that do not specify an
                        explicit value for this requirement. Fractions of a
                        core (for example 0.1) are supported on some batch
                        systems, namely Mesos and singleMachine. Default is
                        1.0
  --defaultDisk INT     The default amount of disk space to dedicate a job.
                        Only applicable to jobs that do not specify an
                        explicit value for this requirement. Standard suffixes
                        like K, Ki, M, Mi, G or Gi are supported. Default is
                        2.0G
  --defaultPreemptable BOOL
                        Set if jobs that do not specifically prohibit it should
                        able to run on preemptable (spot) nodes.
  --maxCores INT        The maximum number of CPU cores to request from the
                        batch system at any one time. Standard suffixes like
                        K, Ki, M, Mi, G or Gi are supported.
  --maxMemory INT       The maximum amount of memory to request from the batch
                        system at any one time. Standard suffixes like K, Ki,
                        M, Mi, G or Gi are supported.
  --maxDisk INT         The maximum amount of disk space to request from the
                        batch system at any one time. Standard suffixes like
                        K, Ki, M, Mi, G or Gi are supported.
  --retryCount RETRYCOUNT
                        Number of times to retry a failing job before giving
                        up and labeling job failed. default=1
  --doubleMem           If set, batch jobs which die due to reaching memory
                        limit on batch schedulers will have their memory
			doubled and they will be retried. The remaining
			retry count will be reduced by 1. Currently only
			supported by LSF. default=False.
  --maxJobDuration MAXJOBDURATION
                        Maximum runtime of a job (in seconds) before we kill
                        it (this is a lower bound, and the actual time before
                        killing the job may be longer).
  --rescueJobsFrequency RESCUEJOBSFREQUENCY
                        Period of time to wait (in seconds) between checking
                        for missing/overlong jobs, that is jobs which get lost
                        by the batch system.
  --maxServiceJobs MAXSERVICEJOBS
                        The maximum number of service jobs that can be run
                        concurrently, excluding service jobs running on
                        preemptable nodes. default=9223372036854775807
  --maxPreemptableServiceJobs MAXPREEMPTABLESERVICEJOBS
                        The maximum number of service jobs that can run
                        concurrently on preemptable nodes.
                        default=9223372036854775807
  --deadlockWait DEADLOCKWAIT
                        Time, in seconds, to tolerate the workflow running only
                        the same service jobs, with no jobs to use them, before
                        declaring the workflow to be deadlocked and stopping.
                        default=60
  --deadlockCheckInterval DEADLOCKCHECKINTERVAL
                        Time, in seconds, to wait between checks to see if the
                        workflow is stuck running only service jobs, with no
                        jobs to use them. Should be shorter than
                        --deadlockWait. May need to be increased if the batch
                        system cannot enumerate running jobs quickly enough, or
                        if polling for running jobs is placing an unacceptable
                        load on a shared cluster. default=30
  --statePollingWait STATEPOLLINGWAIT
                        Time, in seconds, to wait before doing a scheduler
                        query for job state. Return cached results if within
                        the waiting period.

  **Miscellaneous Options**

  --disableCaching      Disables caching in the file store. This flag must be
                        set to use a batch system that does not support
                        cleanup, such as Parasol.
  --disableChaining     Disables chaining of jobs (chaining uses one job's
                        resource allocation for its successor job if
                        possible).
  --maxLogFileSize MAXLOGFILESIZE
                        The maximum size of a job log file to keep (in bytes),
                        log files larger than this will be truncated to the
                        last X bytes. Setting this option to zero will prevent
                        any truncation. Setting this option to a negative
                        value will truncate from the beginning. Default=62.5 K
  --writeLogs FILEPATH
                        Write worker logs received by the leader into their
                        own files at the specified path. Any non-empty standard
                        output and error from failed batch system jobs will also
                        be written into files at this path. The current working
                        directory will be used if a path is not specified
                        explicitly. Note: By default only the logs of failed
                        jobs are returned to leader. Set log level to 'debug'
                        to get logs back from successful jobs, and adjust
                        'maxLogFileSize' to control the truncation limit for
                        worker logs.
  --writeLogsGzip FILEPATH
                        Identical to -\\-writeLogs except the logs files are
                        gzipped on the leader.
  --realTimeLogging     Enable real-time logging from workers to masters.
  --sseKey SSEKEY       Path to file containing 32 character key to be used
                        for server-side encryption on awsJobStore or
                        googleJobStore. SSE will not be used if this flag is
                        not passed.
  --setEnv NAME
                        NAME=VALUE or NAME, -e NAME=VALUE or NAME are also valid.
                        Set an environment variable early on in the worker. If
                        VALUE is omitted, it will be looked up in the current
                        environment. Independently of this option, the worker
                        will try to emulate the leader's environment before
                        running a job. Using this option, a variable can be
                        injected into the worker process itself before it is
                        started.
  --servicePollingInterval SERVICEPOLLINGINTERVAL
                        Interval of time service jobs wait between polling for
                        the existence of the keep-alive flag (default=60)
  --debugWorker         Experimental no forking mode for local debugging.
                        Specifically, workers are not forked and stderr/stdout
                        are not redirected to the log. (default=False)
  --disableProgress     Disables the progress bar shown when standard error is
                        a terminal.


Restart Option
--------------
In the event of failure, Toil can resume the pipeline by adding the argument ``--restart`` and rerunning the
python script. Toil pipelines can even be edited and resumed which is useful for development or troubleshooting.

Running Workflows with Services
-------------------------------

Toil supports jobs, or clusters of jobs, that run as *services* to other
*accessor* jobs. Example services include server databases or Apache Spark
Clusters. As service jobs exist to provide services to accessor jobs their
runtime is dependent on the concurrent running of their accessor jobs. The dependencies
between services and their accessor jobs can create potential deadlock scenarios,
where the running of the workflow hangs because only service jobs are being
run and their accessor jobs can not be scheduled because of too limited resources
to run both simultaneously. To cope with this situation Toil attempts to
schedule services and accessors intelligently, however to avoid a deadlock
with workflows running service jobs it is advisable to use the following parameters:

* ``--maxServiceJobs``: The maximum number of service jobs that can be run concurrently, excluding service jobs running on preemptable nodes.
* ``--maxPreemptableServiceJobs``: The maximum number of service jobs that can run concurrently on preemptable nodes.

Specifying these parameters so that at a maximum cluster size there will be
sufficient resources to run accessors in addition to services will ensure that
such a deadlock can not occur.

If too low a limit is specified then a deadlock can occur in which toil can
not schedule sufficient service jobs concurrently to complete the workflow.
Toil will detect this situation if it occurs and throw a
:class:`toil.DeadlockException` exception. Increasing the cluster size
and these limits will resolve the issue.

Setting Options directly with the Toil Script
---------------------------------------------

It's good to remember that commandline options can be overridden in the Toil script itself.  For example,
:func:`toil.job.Job.Runner.getDefaultOptions` can be used to run toil with all default options, and in this example,
it will override commandline args to run the default options and always run with the "./toilWorkflow" directory
specified as the jobstore:

.. code-block:: python

    options = Job.Runner.getDefaultOptions("./toilWorkflow") # Get the options object

    with Toil(options) as toil:
        toil.start(Job())  # Run the script

However, each option can be explicitly set within the script by supplying arguments (in this example, we are setting
``logLevel = "DEBUG"`` (all log statements are shown) and ``clean="ALWAYS"`` (always delete the jobstore) like so:

.. code-block:: python

    options = Job.Runner.getDefaultOptions("./toilWorkflow") # Get the options object
    options.logLevel = "DEBUG" # Set the log level to the debug level.
    options.clean = "ALWAYS" # Always delete the jobStore after a run

    with Toil(options) as toil:
        toil.start(Job())  # Run the script

However, the usual incantation is to accept commandline args from the user with the following:

.. code-block:: python

    parser = Job.Runner.getDefaultArgumentParser() # Get the parser
    options = parser.parse_args() # Parse user args to create the options object

    with Toil(options) as toil:
        toil.start(Job())  # Run the script

Which can also, of course, then accept script supplied arguments as before (which will overwrite any user supplied args):

.. code-block:: python

    parser = Job.Runner.getDefaultArgumentParser() # Get the parser
    options = parser.parse_args() # Parse user args to create the options object
    options.logLevel = "DEBUG" # Set the log level to the debug level.
    options.clean = "ALWAYS" # Always delete the jobStore after a run

    with Toil(options) as toil:
        toil.start(Job())  # Run the script
