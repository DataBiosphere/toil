Running in Google Compute Engine
================================
After setting up Toil on :ref:`installation-ref`, Toil scripts
can be run just by designating a job store location as shown in
:ref:`quickstart`.

If you wish to use the Google Storage job store, install Toil with the
``google`` extra (:ref:`extras`). Then, create a file named ``.boto`` with your
credentials and some configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [Credentials]
    gs_access_key_id = KEY_ID
    gs_secret_access_key = SECRET_KEY

    [Boto]
    https_validate_certificates = True

    [GSUtil]
    content_language = en
    default_api_version = 2

``gs_access_key_id`` and ``gs_secret_access_key`` can be generated by navigating
to your Google Cloud Storage console and clicking on *Settings*. On
the *Settings* page, navigate to the *Interoperability* tab and click *Enable
interoperability access*. On this page you can now click *Create a new key* to
generate an access key and a matching secret. Insert these into their
respective places in the ``.boto`` file and you will be able to use a Google
job store when invoking a Toil script, as in the following example::

    $ python HelloWorld.py google:projectID:jobStore

The ``projectID`` component of the job store argument above refers your Google
Cloud Project ID in the Google Cloud Console, and will be visible in the
console's banner at the top of the screen. The ``jobStore`` component is a name
of your choosing that you will use to refer to this job store.
