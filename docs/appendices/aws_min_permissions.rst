.. _minAwsPermissions:

Minimum AWS IAM permissions
---------------------------

Toil requires at least the following permissions in an IAM role to operate on a cluster.
These are added by default when launching a cluster. However, ensure that they are present
if creating a custom IAM role when :ref:`launching a cluster <launchAwsClusterDetails>`
with the ``--awsEc2ProfileArn`` parameter.
