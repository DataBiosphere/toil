    ## Executive Summary

    The Workflow Execution Service (WES) API provides a standard way for users to submit workflow requests to workflow execution systems, and to monitor their execution. This API lets users run a single workflow (currently [**CWL**](https://www.commonwl.org/) or [**WDL**](http://www.openwdl.org/) formatted workflows, other types may be supported in the future) on multiple different platforms, clouds, and environments.

    Key features of the API:

    - can request that a workflow be run

    - can pass parameters to that workflow (e.g. input files, cmdline arguments)

    - can get information about running workflows (e.g. status, errors, output file locations)

    - can cancel a running workflow

    ## Introduction

    This document describes the WES API and provides details on the specific endpoints, request formats, and response.  It is intended to provide key information for developers of WES-compatible services as well as clients that will call these WES services.

    Use cases include:

    - "Bring your code to the data": a researcher who has built their own custom analysis can submit it to run on a dataset owned by an external organization, instead of having to make a copy of the data

    - Best-practices pipelines: a researcher who maintains their own controlled data environment can find useful workflows in a shared directory (e.g. Dockstore.org), and run them over their data

    ## Standards

    The WES API specification is written in OpenAPI and embodies a RESTful service philosophy.  It uses JSON in requests and responses and standard HTTP/HTTPS for information transport.

    ## Authorization and Authentication

    Users must supply credentials that establish their identity and authorization in order to use a WES endpoint. We recommend that WES implementations use an OAuth2 [**bearer token**](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/), although they can choose other mechanisms if appropriate. WES callers can use the `auth_instructions_url` from the [**`service-info` endpoint**](https://ga4gh.github.io/workflow-execution-service-schemas/#/WorkflowExecutionService/GetServiceInfo) to learn how to obtain and use a bearer token for a particular implementation.
    <br><br>

    The WES implementation is responsible for checking that a user is authorized to submit workflow run requests. The particular authorization policy is up to the WES implementer.
    <br><br>

    Systems like WES need to also address the ability to pass credentials with jobs for input and output access.  In the current version of WES, the passing of credentials to authenticate and authorize access to inputs and outputs, as well as mandates about necessary file transfer protocols to support, are out of scope.  However, parallel work on the Data Object Service is addressing ways to pass around access credentials with data object references, opening up the possibility that a future version of WES will provide concrete mechanisms for workflow runs to access data using credentials different than those used for WES.  This is a work in progress and support of DOS in WES will be added in a future release of WES.

      description: >-
        This endpoint creates a new workflow run and
        returns a `RunId` to monitor its progress.


        The `workflow_attachment` array may be used to upload files
        that are required to execute the workflow, including the primary
        workflow, tools imported by the workflow, other files
        referenced by the workflow, or files which are part of the
        input.  The implementation should stage these files to a
        temporary directory and execute the workflow from there.
        These parts must have a Content-Disposition header with a
        "filename" provided for each part.  Filenames may include
        subdirectories, but must not include references to parent
        directories with '..' -- implementations should guard against
        maliciously constructed filenames.


        The `workflow_url` is either an absolute URL to a workflow
        file that is accessible by the WES endpoint, or a relative URL
        corresponding to one of the files attached using
        `workflow_attachment`.


        The `workflow_params` JSON object specifies input parameters,
        such as input files.  The exact format of the JSON object
        depends on the conventions of the workflow language being
        used.  Input files should either be absolute URLs, or relative
        URLs corresponding to files uploaded using
        `workflow_attachment`.  The WES endpoint must understand and
        be able to access URLs supplied in the input.  This is
        implementation specific.
 
 
        The `workflow_type` is the type of workflow language and
        must be "CWL" or "WDL" currently (or another alternative 
        supported by this WES instance).
 
 
        The `workflow_type_version` is the version of the workflow language
        submitted and must be one supported by this WES instance.

      This provides a safe default for messages where this field is missing,
      for example, so that a missing field does not accidentally imply that
      the state is QUEUED.


       - QUEUED: The task is queued.


      - INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run.
      For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.


      - RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor
      has been started.


      - PAUSED: The task is paused.
      An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.


       - COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
      and output files have been successfully uploaded.


       - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
      this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.


       - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
      for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out
      of disk space, etc.


       - CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.


        - CANCELING: The task was canceled by the user, and is in the process of stopping.
