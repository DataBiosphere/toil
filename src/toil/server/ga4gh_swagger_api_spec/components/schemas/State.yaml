description: >
  State can take any of the following values:

    + UNKNOWN: The state of the task is unknown. This provides a safe default for messages where this field is missing, for example, so that a missing field does not accidentally imply that the state is QUEUED.

    + QUEUED: The task is queued.

    + INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run. For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.

    + RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor has been started.

    + PAUSED: The task is paused. An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.

    + COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
    and output files have been successfully uploaded.

    + EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
  this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.

    + SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
  for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out of disk space, etc.

    + CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.

    + CANCELING: The task was canceled by the user, and is in the process of stopping.
