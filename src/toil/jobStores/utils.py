    >>> import sys, shutil, codecs
    >>> class MyPipe(WritablePipe):

    Hello, world!

    Each instance of this class creates a thread and invokes the readFrom method in that thread.
    The thread will be join()ed upon normal exit from the context manager, i.e. the body of the
    `with` statement. If an exception occurs, the thread will not be joined but a well-behaved
    :meth:`.readFrom` implementation will terminate shortly thereafter due to the pipe having
    been closed.

    Now, exceptions in the reader thread will be reraised in the main thread:

    ...         raise RuntimeError('Hello, world!')
    >>> with MyPipe() as writable:
