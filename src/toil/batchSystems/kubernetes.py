# The Right Way to use the Kubernetes module is to `import kubernetes` and then you get all your stuff as like ApiClient. But this doesn't work for the stubs: the stubs seem to only support importing things from the internal modules in `kubernetes` where they are actually defined. See for example <https://github.com/MaterializeInc/kubernetes-stubs/issues/9 and <https://github.com/MaterializeInc/kubernetes-stubs/issues/10>. So we just import all the things we use into our global namespace here.
