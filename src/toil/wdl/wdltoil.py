# We define a URI scheme kind of like but not actually compatible with the one
# we use for CWL. CWL brings along the file basename in its file type, but
# WDL.Value.File doesn't. So we need to make sure we stash that somewhere in
# the URI.
# TODO: We need to also make sure files from the same source directory end up
# in the same destination directory, when dealing with basename conflicts.


# We want to use hashlib.file_digest to avoid a 3-line hashing loop like
# MiniWDL has. But it is only in 3.11+
#
# So we need to have a function that is either it or a fallback with the
# hashing loop.
#
# So we need to be able to articulate the type of that function for MyPy, to
# avoid needing to write a function with the *exact* signature of the import
# (and not e.g. one that needs slightly different methods of its fileobjs or is
# missing some kwarg features).

# substituted when that declaration is referenced in the command template."

# This has to be true even if the File is the result of a WDL function that is
# run *during* the evaluation of the command string, via a placeholder
# expression evaluation.

# Really there are 3 filename spaces in play: Toil filestore URLs,

# Also, the workflow can depend on the string contents of the workflow-visible
# names. So we always need to have those hold the original file paths/URLs in
# leader space when we are at workflow scope.

# So we have our own notion of a "virtualized" file path that we hide in an
# attribute on the File values, and our own separate set of virtualizing and
# devirtualizing functions to fill this in or to download the file and put a
# local-node path into the file value (which we confusingly call
