class CachingFileStore(AbstractFileStore):
    """
    A cache-enabled file store.

    Provides files that are read out as symlinks or hard links into a cache
    directory for the node, if permitted by the workflow.

    Also attempts to write files back to the backing JobStore asynchronously,
    after quickly taking them into the cache. Writes are only required to
    finish when the job's actual state after running is committed back to the
    job store.

    Internaly, manages caching using a database. Each node has its own
    database, shared between all the workers on the node. The database contains
    several tables:

    files contains one entry for each file in the cache. Each entry knows the
    path to its data on disk. It also knows its global file ID, its state, and
    its owning worker PID. If the owning worker dies, another worker will pick
    it up. It also knows its size.

    File states are:

    - "cached": happily stored in the cache. Reads can happen immediately.
      Owner is null. May be adopted and moved to state "deleting" by anyone, if
      it has no outstanding immutable references.

    - "downloading": in the process of being saved to the cache by a non-null
      owner. Reads must wait for the state to become "cached". If the worker
      dies, goes to state "deleting", because we don't know if it was fully
      downloaded or if anyone still needs it. No references can be created to a
      "downloading" file except by the worker responsible for downloading it.

    - "uploadable": stored in the cache and ready to be written to the job
      store by a non-null owner. Transitions to "uploading" when a (thread of)
      the owning worker process picks it up and begins uploading it, to free
      cache space or to commit a completed job. If the worker dies, goes to
      state "cached", because it may have outstanding immutable references from
      the dead-but-not-cleaned-up job that was going to write it.

    - "uploading": stored in the cache and being written to the job store by a
      non-null owner. Transitions to "cached" when successfully uploaded. If
      the worker dies, goes to state "cached", because it may have outstanding
      immutable references from the dead-but-not-cleaned-up job that was
      writing it.

    - "deleting": in the process of being removed from the cache by a non-null
      owner. Will eventually be removed from the database.

    refs contains one entry for each outstanding reference to a cached file
    (hard link, symlink, or full copy). The table name is refs instead of
    references because references is an SQL reserved word. It remembers what
    job ID has the reference, and the path the reference is at. References have
    three states:

    - "immutable": represents a hardlink or symlink to a file in the cache.
      Dedicates the file's size in bytes of the job's disk requirement to the
      cache, to be used to cache this file or to keep around other files
      without references. May be upgraded to "copying" if the link can't
      actually be created.

    - "copying": records that a file in the cache is in the process of being
      copied to a path. Will be upgraded to a mutable reference eventually.

    - "mutable": records that a file from the cache was copied to a certain
      path. Exist only to support deleteLocalFile's API. Only files with only
      mutable references (or no references) are eligible for eviction.

    jobs contains one entry for each job currently running. It keeps track of
    the job's ID, the worker that is supposed to be running the job, the job's
    disk requirement, and the job's local temp dir path that will need to be
    cleaned up. When workers check for jobs whose workers have died, they null
    out the old worker, and grab ownership of and clean up jobs and their
    references until the null-worker jobs are gone.

    properties contains key, value pairs for tracking total space available,
    and whether caching is free for this run.
