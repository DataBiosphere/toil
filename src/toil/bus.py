"""
Message types and message bus for leader component coordination.

Historically, the Toil Leader has been organized around functions calling other
functions to "handle" different things happening. Over time, it has become very
brittle: exactly the right handling functions need to be called in exactly the
right order, or it gets confused and does the wrong thing.

The MessageBus is meant to let the leader avoid this by more loosely coupling
its components together, by having them communicate by sending messages instead
of by calling functions.

When events occur (like a job coming back from the batch system with a failed
exit status), this will be translated into a message that will be sent to the
bus. Then, all the leader components that need to react to this message in some
way (by, say, decrementing the retry count) would listen for the relevant
messages on the bus and react to them. If a new component needs to be added, it
can be plugged into the message bus and receive and react to messages without
interfering with existing components' ability to react to the same messages.

Eventually, the different aspects of the Leader could become separate objects.

By default, messages stay entirely within the Toil leader process, and are not
persisted anywhere, not even in the JobStore.

The Message Bus also provides an extension point: its messages can be
serialized to a file by the leader (see the --writeMessages option), and they
can then be decoded using MessageBus.scan_bus_messages() (as is done in the
Toil WES server backend). By replaying the messages and tracking their effects
on job state, you can get an up-to-date view of the state of the jobs in a
workflow. This includes information, such as whether jobs are issued or
running, or what jobs have completely finished, which is not persisted in the
JobStore.

The MessageBus instance for the leader process is owned by the Toil leader, but
the BatchSystem has an opportunity to connect to it, and can send (or listen
for) messages. Right now the BatchSystem deos not *have* to send or receive any
messages; the Leader is responsible for polling it via the BatchSystem API and
generating the events. But a BatchSystem implementation *may* send additional
events (like JobAnnotationMessage).

Currently, the MessageBus is implemented using pypubsub, and so messages are
always handled in a single Thread, the Toil leader's main loop thread. If other
components send events, they will be shipped over to that thread inside the
MessageBus. Communication between processes is allowed using
MessageBus.connect_output_file() and MessageBus.scan_bus_messages().
