    A thread that automatically scales the number of either preemptible or non-preemptible worker
    nodes according to the resource requirements of the queued jobs.

    The scaling calculation is essentially as follows: start with 0 estimated worker nodes. For
    each queued job, check if we expect it can be scheduled into a worker node before a certain time
    (currently one hour). Otherwise, attempt to add a single new node of the smallest type that
    can fit that job.

    At each scaling decision point a comparison between the current, C, and newly estimated
    number of nodes is made. If the absolute difference is less than beta * C then no change
    is made, else the size of the cluster is adapted. The beta factor is an inertia parameter
    that prevents continual fluctuations in the number of nodes.
